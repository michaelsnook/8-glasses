      <p>Setting goals and forming habits shouldn't be a chore, so I'm making this app to help me track my life metrics, one click at a time, and review my progress as I go.</p>

      <p>Set daily or weekly goals for anything you want. Track incrementals, reps, or floats. Encourage yourself with positive goals, or keep your vices in check with "no more than" types.</p>
      
      <p>Eight Glasses is free and open source. You can't actually create your own account (yet), but you can get the code from <a href="https://github.com/michaelsnook/8-glasses/">the GitHub repository</a> and set it up on your own computer, if you're into that sort of thing.</p>

      <h3>... and a hobby project to help me learn python for the web.</h3>
      <p>I started with the tutorial for <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, an open source micro-framework for Python. The html, css, and modals rely on <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, (which uses <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a> and <a href="http://modernizr.com/">modernizr.js</a>), and colors from <a href="http://clrs.cc">clrs.cc</a>. There's still a lot left to do:</p>
      <div class="row"><div class="large-5 columns">
        <ul>
          <li>Summary tables showing how you've been doing during past days/weeks (or else you can only see your progress for <em>today</em> or <em>this week</em>).</li>
          <li>Visualize multiple progress metrics, like the area graph in <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1256572">this d3 example</a>.</li>
          <li>Figure out how to put it on the public web (probably through Heroku).</li>
          <li>Switch off SQLite to PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy to abstract database operations.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="large-5 columns">
        <ul>
          <li>Add support and authentication for multiple user accounts.</li>
          <li>Add fun / configurable messages of encouragement for when you do good things.</li>
          <li>Perhaps enable sharing on social media when you surpass a positive goal.</li>
          <li>I might make each section into a subtle progress bar. That could be neat.</li>
        </ul>
      </div></div>
      <p>But I've never done any of those things before, so who knows if I'll be successful. </p>
